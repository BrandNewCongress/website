<h2>Campaign Manager</h2>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Knoxville, TN</p>
<p><strong>SALARY:</strong> $60,000-$70,000 (no salary history required, all team members will be paid the same once final salary is decided)</p>
<p><strong>HOURS:</strong> 40+</p>
<p>Brand New Congress is running a nationwide distributed self-serve volunteer campaign to take advantage of our wide volunteer network and have the biggest effect possible for our campaigns on the ground. The distributed team will be in charge of running the tools (dialer, texting, self-serve canvassing, events map and moderation) and running the volunteers in places without local campaigns yet (recruiting and training event hosts, turnout to events, data entry, building and growing local volunteer groups).</p>
<p>BNC is not a traditional establishment campaign and campaign managers for BNC will be non-traditional as well. A campaign manager will be responsible for managing between 1-5 campaigns at a time and won&#39;t be responsible for building out and hiring all campaign staff and managing all aspects of the campaign and vendors directly. &nbsp;Instead, the role of the campaign manager is largely two-fold:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1) Be an excellent project manager that makes sure everything their local campaign needs is done correctly and on deadline. Campaign needs and roles will be split between national teams handling comms, field, legal, operations, and others. Campaign managers work with other national teams at BNC to ensure everything is getting done on time and deadlines are being met by volunteers or vendors, but will not have to deal with individual vendors or consultants at all.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">2) Manage candidate time and interactions (strategist/scheduler/mentor/counselor/remote body person). Talk with the candidates, get approvals from them when needed, and be their main point of contact. This means being able to answer candidate questions about all aspects of the campaign or connecting them with the proper BNC team, handling their schedule, and making sure candidates are receiving the training, policy, and coaching resources the other teams in Brand New Congress are developing. You will be point person on managing the overall campaign calendar, monitoring the situation on the ground, and reporting that information down to the local campaign and up to the national leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Campaign managers need to be:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>People who are obsessive about hitting deadlines and goals, are great at coordinating with multiple other teams to get work done, feel very at home with making project plans, &nbsp;and are excellent at thinking through every last detail to make sure plans are executed without a hitch.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Positive people who will be able to make sure BNC candidates feel confident as they go forth.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Campaign managers will need to be ok with changing plans as the campaign changes and be able to execute those changes rapidly and explain those changes in a confident way to candidates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>They don&rsquo;t need to know the answer to every question that a candidate could bring up, but they need to make the candidate confident they will find the answer, are trustworthy, and are working for their best interest.</p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>SKILLS:</h3>

<p>Excel formula master / Google suite maven</p>
<p>Field experience (calls, texts, doors), preferably as staff or in a volunteer lead role</p>
<p>Comfortable working on a remote team</p>
<p>Like to use gifs in everyday conversation</p>

<h2>Distributed Organizer</h2>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Knoxville, TN</p>
<p><strong>SALARY:</strong> $60,000-$70,000 (no salary history required, all team members will be paid the same once final salary is decided)</p>
<p><strong>HOURS:</strong> 40+</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brand New Congress is running a nationwide distributed self-serve volunteer campaign to take advantage of our wide volunteer network and have the biggest effect possible for our campaigns on the ground. The distributed team will be in charge of running the tools (dialer, texting, self-serve canvassing, events map and moderation) and running the volunteers in places without local campaigns yet (recruiting and training event hosts, turnout to events, data entry, building and growing local volunteer groups).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will run a distributed volunteer system that</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Allows volunteers to self-start field activities and groups that actually make a difference on the ground without requiring staff bottlenecks or even staff interaction</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>seamlessly moves volunteers from distributed management to local management when campaigns get started</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>fully integrates local and distributed volunteer efforts on the backend to make sure we are hitting priority lists and doing the action that each vol subset can do the best (distributed calls and texts, local door knocks).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Since field work is 7 days a week until the end of time, distributed team members will focus on one aspect of our program (texting, dialing, canvassing, events hosts/turnout, software development, etc) but will be cross trained so we can maintain an aggressive, but sustainable workload.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
<h3>DUTIES:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Help set-up and create systems to manage distributed software tools for volunteer and local campaigns</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create and manage high level volunteer teams to run the tools</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Constantly test and evaluate our current structure to find ways to be more effective</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Recruit and train volunteers to do direct voter contact from events and from home</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NEEDS:</h3>
<p>Hard worker and quick learner with a good sense of humor and a positive attitude (obviously). &nbsp;Think about how much you work on 1 campaign and multiply that by a few hundred and that is our task. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be hard work. Our tools may change and our structures definitely will evolve so distributed members need to be able to quickly learn new systems and concisely pass that knowledge on to volunteers and team members.</p>
<p>Never satisfied with current production and constantly striving to be a little bit more efficient and effective. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to be running a huge program so increasing efficiency of a volunteer shift by a few percentage points will make a big difference on election day. Team members will constantly be running tests on their programs to see how to improve our production and how to win more votes. &nbsp;If you see a report with 2 hour 40 minute average shift time and your first question is &ldquo;why isn&#39;t that 3 hours?&rdquo; then you are perfect for the team.</p>
<p>Care more about the end goal and metrics than any particular structure or solution. &nbsp;We will create systems, test them, find out they are not working as we thought and burn them down. &nbsp;Team members should be able to leave ego behind and move on to another solution if we find something better.</p>
<p>Self starters who enjoy trying to find solutions to new problems. &nbsp;Team members should be able to cut and paste some excel formulas or jump into new software and figure it out without having to wait a week to see the demo. Most distributed team tools are going to be new configurations of old tools or even new things on their own so there won&rsquo;t be a to-do guide for how to set up or what we need to do. &nbsp;If an automation flow conversation is fun for you (&ldquo;then new data here will trigger this system to send an email while they also get an asana task for local organizer outreach and their manager will be pinged on slack&hellip;&ldquo;) then you are perfect for this team.</p>
