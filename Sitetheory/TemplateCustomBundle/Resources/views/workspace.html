<p>I am an Army veteran with a voting record that crosses all party lines. I&#39;m running on an Independent Republican ticket -- but I&#39;m no RINO. I believe in what the Republican party IS, not what they&#39;re doing or who&rsquo;s in office. I believe in the foundation of democracy -- liberty, opportunity, and justice -- without which our republic wouldn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m running on a platform of foundational reform that will free Congress to work for the people as the Constitution intended.</p>

<p>I was born in Warner Robins, Georgia and was blessed to be adopted at birth by a military family. I spent many happy years traveling with my family as my father was reassigned from base to base. I&#39;ve lived and served in red districts, blue districts, libertarian districts and everywhere from Germany to Iraq.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a military police officer and an active duty National Guard recruiter in Georgia (where I was promoted to Station Commander, in charge of training other recruiters), as well as a career counselor for Soldiers. Two years ago I was diagnosed with medical conditions that lead to my medical retirement from the Georgia Army National Guard. I retired as a Sergeant First Class under honorable conditions, at which point I decided to fulfill my 20 year commitment that I made to serve the citizens of the State of Georgia by running for the 8th District of Georgia in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>I was very passionate about being a Soldier. But gradually watching where our government was headed and being in charge of recruiting and counseling citizen-Soldiers -- the children of my fellow constituents, who were signing up for something they really didn&#39;t understand, but which I did -- led me post-career to a humbling recognition of the might of our military and the abuse of the Executive branch, who were willing to misuse it for strong-arm political and financial gain around the world.</p>

<p>Facing this decision, I moved into the private sector as a retail manager. It was exhausting, debilitating and demeaning work - and an eye-opener for me, seeing firsthand what little regard there is for the American worker by those who earn billions at their expense. It was the most miserable experience I have encountered while trying to raise my family. The physical hazards and my moral compass compelled me to resign, and seek a way to honor workers as well as my conscience.</p>

<p class="pullout">Here in the 8th district -- and throughout our state -- we see tremendous wealth and growth, but far too little of it finds its way to our poorest counties.</p>

<p>After leaving the corporate sector, I founded a small family landscaping business back in my hometown of Warner Robins. I love running a small business that not only helps provide for my family, it also creates employment for our community in Houston County. I share the joy of my two children with my husband Nate, a nine-year old son and five year-old daughter. My husband Nate has dropped out of college in order to run the company and provide for our family while I make this bid for Congress. I couldn&#39;t be more proud of him or more grateful to him.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, and as a long-time NG recruiter in my district, I&rsquo;ve gotten to know individuals in many counties across Georgia and see firsthand their opportunities, as well as their lack of them. Here in the 8th district -- and throughout our state -- we see tremendous wealth and growth, but far too little of it finds its way to our poorest counties and neediest and equally deserving citizens.</p>

<p>My dedication to public service is the reason behind my running. Wherever the door opens and God leads, I&#39;ll go. I will continue to serve you, and the nation I love, in my mission to create a Brand New Congress.</p>
