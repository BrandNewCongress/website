    <p class="interviewQuestion">Are there specific things you want to do in Congress because of your own experiences?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;When I was working in childcare, I didn&rsquo;t have enough money to send my own children to childcare. But I made too much to get any help paying for childcare. So I think it&rsquo;s important for us to invest money in child care and in Pre-K for all children. I love the Idea that more children will have access to Pre-K to prepare for school. Our children need to be prepared. I would also love to see teacher&rsquo;s pay increase.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">Can you talk about the challenges for low-income families in St. Louis?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the system is fighting them while they are trying to take care of their families. It&rsquo;s very tough to get a job in the city. You&rsquo;re held back by simple things like transportation, childcare and access to after-school programs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the bus line because you can&rsquo;t afford a car and you have to take a bus to get your kids to daycare. You have to drop your kids off early and pick them up late. You want them to have a chance to eat a good breakfast and a good after-school snack. You want to make sure they have the nutrition they need to perform better. But you need a lot of extra time to get to work. And if you&rsquo;re late picking them up, your child can lose their spot in childcare.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&quot;I was ashamed, it was humiliating. People thought &lsquo;you have a husband, you should be okay&rsquo;. We would drive around the city to make sure we weren&rsquo;t in front of someone&rsquo;s home too long. We thought they might call the police.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">What was it like to be homeless?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;While I was homeless I really didn&rsquo;t want people to know because I had a job. That was hard. There&rsquo;s a stigma for people who are homeless and don&rsquo;t have a job, but a different stigma for people who have a job.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I was ashamed, it was humiliating. People thought &lsquo;you have a husband, you should be okay&rsquo;. We would drive around the city to make sure we weren&rsquo;t in front of someone&rsquo;s home too long. We thought they might call the police.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;People who are homeless are just people without a home. I want to break the stigma. There are people with mental illnesses who are homeless. People who are not substance abusers, people with jobs. Whole families are homeless. Those are temporary situations.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">What can Congress do to help the homeless people you work with?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;One thing is, we have to increase the money we put into job training. That&rsquo;s a big issue. We have a lot of people who are looking for jobs but can&rsquo;t get hired because they don&rsquo;t have an address. We need shelters where there are job programs and childcare.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We also need to loosen restrictions in housing communities. When shelters require ID, that is a big hindrance. People who live on the streets are robbed. If they sleep on the street, their stuff gets tossed by police or damaged. To get a new ID they have to have an address, utility bill and another form of state ID. How can you show a utility bill when you don&rsquo;t have a front door?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&quot;I have patients who don&rsquo;t even realize they are getting better because they are so stressed about how to pay for their next prescription.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">As a community health nurse, do you support Medicare for all?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Everyday I am looking for resources to help clients to get the medication they so desperately need. Many make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford insurance. Medicare for all would help our clients become stable. Once my patients become pre-transient, it&rsquo;s hard to get them stable again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Medicare for all, I believe would relieve so much frustration for nurses&mdash;the time we lose looking for resources. We could focus more on caring for our patients. I have patients who don&rsquo;t even realize they are getting better because they are so stressed about how to pay for their next prescription.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We also see kids who are not in college or kids who have to leave college that are dropped by their insurance. Medicare for all would help those families.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">Are you involved in the Black Lives Matter Movement?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really part of Black Lives Matter. I am part of the Ferguson movement, which was separate from Black Lives Matter. At the time [of the shooting] when I heard what happened, I wanted to go out and see what was going on. I wanted to be present. I wanted to see justice. I went back everyday to see if justice would come, and it didn&rsquo;t. We formed a family. We realized we needed to not stop. We saw how regular, everyday people affected the world.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s very important to bring people together who represent our communities. I stand with the Muslims in our community, the LGBT people of our community and the families in our community. It&rsquo;s my duty as a public servant to represent everyone.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <p class="interviewQuestion">How did the Ferguson Truth Project start?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Ferguson Truth Project came out of the Michael Brown murder. The media and the police had their own narrative but it was not what we were seeing on the ground. I thought it was an opportunity for real people to get their stories out. So we decided to build a national platform where their stories could be told. Someone else was getting to the families first before they could tell their stories. We pulled together activists from all over the country.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="interviewQuestion">What do you think makes you different from other politicians?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am the people that I represent. I have been through what they&rsquo;re going through. Whatever the needs of the people are, that&rsquo;s what I work for.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Many politicians are complacent and kind of glide up under the radar. They&rsquo;re not bad, they&rsquo;re not great and they aren&rsquo;t helping. I will fight for what I know is right until we see change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am a coalition builder. I think it&rsquo;s very important to bring people together who really represent our communities. I stand with the Muslims in our community, the LGBT people of our community and the families in our community. I understand feeling overlooked by politicians and government. It&rsquo;s my duty as a public servant to represent everyone.&rdquo;</p>
