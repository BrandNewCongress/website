                        <h2>Why You Should Support Drafting Tynisha Tyson</h2>
                        <p>Tynisha Tyson is described as an ‘anchor’ of Milner Elementary, the school in Hartford, Connecticut’s North End -- the same neighborhood where she was raised --  where she serves as a social worker. On a daily basis, she works with children who suffer from abuse, neglect, abandonment and extreme poverty. There are students at Milner worrying about their next meal, being evicted from their home, witnessing domestic violence, or feeling the rupture of a parent landing in prison. </p>
                        <p>Tyson’s job includes group counseling, consulting with teachers on student behavior, home visits, writing referrals for families who need more social services, and encouraging parents who may feel a stigma with mental health or may have trauma histories themselves to accept the support.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is knowing when a student needs a hug or stocking the birthday box that she keeps in a corner of her office, she is constantly putting her students first and showing them love when they need it most. In her own words: "I try to be that constant in their life... I try to be that person that is going to contradict the hurt, the pain, in their lives. ... To try to heal their wounds. That's it.</p>
                        <p class="callToAction">If you’d like to see Tynisha in Congress fighting for those in poverty, support us so we can convince Tynisha Tyson to run for Congress.
